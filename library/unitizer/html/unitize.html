<h2>Unitize an R Test Script</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Turn standard R scripts into unit tests by storing the expressions therein
along with the results of their evaluation, and provides an interactive
prompt to review tests.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
unitize(
  test.file = NULL,
  store.id = NULL,
  state = getOption("unitizer.state"),
  pre = NULL,
  post = NULL,
  history = getOption("unitizer.history.file"),
  interactive.mode = interactive(),
  force.update = FALSE,
  auto.accept = character(0L),
  use.diff = getOption("unitizer.use.diff")
)

review(store.id = NULL)

unitize_dir(
  test.dir = NULL,
  store.ids = filename_to_storeid,
  pattern = "^[^.].*\\.[Rr]$",
  state = getOption("unitizer.state"),
  pre = NULL,
  post = NULL,
  history = getOption("unitizer.history.file"),
  interactive.mode = interactive(),
  force.update = FALSE,
  auto.accept = character(0L),
  use.diff = getOption("unitizer.use.diff")
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>path to the file containing tests, if supplied path does not
match an actual system path, <code>unitizer</code> will try to infer a possible
path.  If NULL, will look for a file in the &ldquo;tests/unitizer&rdquo; package
folder if it exists, or in &ldquo;.&rdquo; if it does not.
See <code><a href="infer_unitizer_location.html">infer_unitizer_location</a></code>) for details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>store.id</code></td>
<td>
<p>if NULL (default), <code>unitizer</code> will select a directory
based on the <code>test.file</code> name by replacing <code>.[rR]</code> with
<code>.unitizer</code>.  You can also specify a directory name, or pass any
object that has a defined <code><a href="set_unitizer.html">get_unitizer</a></code> method which allows
you to specify non-standard <code>unitizer</code> storage mechanisms (see
<code><a href="set_unitizer.html">get_unitizer</a></code>).  Finally, you can pass an actual
<code>unitizer</code> object if you are using <code>review</code>; see <code>store.ids</code>
for <code>unitize_dir</code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>state</code></td>
<td>
<p>character(1L) one of
<code>c("prisitine", "suggested", "basic", "off", "safe")</code>, an
environment, or a state object produced by <code><a href="unitizerState.html">state</a></code> or
<code><a href="unitizerState.html">in_pkg</a></code>; modifies how <code>unitizer</code> manages aspects of
session state that could affect test evaluation, including the parent
evaluation environment.  For more details see <code><a href="unitizerState.html">unitizerState</a></code>
documentation and <code>vignette("unitizer_reproducible_tests")</code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pre</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL, or a character vector pointing to files and/or directories.
If a character vector, then any files referenced therein will be sourced,
and any directories referenced therein will be scanned non-recursively for
visible files ending in &quot;.r&quot; or &quot;.R&quot;, which are then also sourced.  If
NULL, then <code>unitizer</code> will look for a directory named &quot;_pre&quot; in the
directory containing the first test file and will treat it as if you had
specified it in <code>pre</code>.  Any objects created by those scripts will be
put into a parent environment for all tests.  This provides a mechanism for
creating objects that are shared across different test files, as well as
loading shared packages.  Unlike objects created during test evaluation,
any objects created here will not be stored in the <code>unitizer</code> so you
will have not direct way to check whether these objects changed across
<code>unitizer</code> runs.  Additionally, typing <code>ls</code> from the review
prompt will not list these objects.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>post</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL, or a character vector pointing to files and/or directories.
See <code>pre</code>.  If NULL will look for a directory named &quot;_post&quot; in the
directory containing the first test file.  Scripts are run just prior to
exiting <code>unitizer</code>. <code>post</code> code will be run in an environment
with the environment used to run <code>pre</code> as the parent.  This means that
any objects created in <code>pre</code> will be available to <code>post</code>, which
you can use to your advantage if there are some things you do in <code>pre</code>
you wish to undo in <code>post</code>. Keep in mind that <code>unitizer</code> can
manage most aspects of global state, so you should not need to use this
parameter to unload packages, remove objects, etc.  See details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>character(1L) path to file to use to store history generated
during interactive unitizer session; the default is an empty string, which
leads to <code>unitizer</code> using a temporary file, set to NULL to disable
history capture.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>interactive.mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical(1L) whether to run in interactive mode (
request user input when needed) or not (error if user input is required,
e.g. if all tests do not pass).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>force.update</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical(1L) if TRUE will give the option to re-store a
unitizer after re-evaluating all the tests even if all tests passed.
you can also toggle this option from the unitizer prompt by typing <code>O</code>,
though <code>force.update=TRUE</code> will force update irrespective of what
you do with <code>O</code> at the prompt</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>auto.accept</code></td>
<td>
<p>character(X) ADVANCED USE ONLY: YOU CAN EASILY DESTROY
YOUR <code>unitizer</code> WITH THIS; whether to auto-accept tests without
prompting, use values in <code>c("new", "failed", "deleted", "error")</code> to
specify which type(s) of test you wish to auto accept (i.e. same as typing
<code>"Y"</code> at the <code>unitizer</code> prompt) or empty character vector to turn
off (default)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>use.diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE, whether to use diffs when there is an error,
if FALSE uses <code><a href="../../base/html/all.equal.html">all.equal</a></code> instead.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test.dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>the directory to run the tests on; if NULL will use the
&ldquo;tests/unitizer&rdquo; package folder if it exists, or &ldquo;.&rdquo; if it
does not.  See <code><a href="infer_unitizer_location.html">infer_unitizer_location</a></code>) for details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>store.ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>one of </p>

<ul>
<li><p> a function that converts test file names to <code>unitizer</code> ids; if
<code>unitize</code>ing multiple files will be <code>lapply</code>ed over each file
</p>
</li>
<li><p> a character vector with <code>unitizer</code> ids, must be the same
length as the number of test files being reviewed (see <code>store.id</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> a list of unitizer ids, must be the same length as the number of
test files being reviewed; useful when you implement special storage
mechanisms for the <code>unitizers</code> (see <code><a href="set_unitizer.html">get_unitizer</a></code>)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>a regular expression used to match what subset of files in

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>unitize</code> creates unit tests from a single R file, and
<code>unitize_dir</code> creates tests from all the R files in the specified
directory (analogous to <code>testthat::test_dir</code>).
</p>
<p><code>unitizer</code> stores are identified by <code>unitizer</code> ids, which by
default are character strings containing the location of the folder the
<code>unitizer</code> RDS files are kept in.  <code>unitize</code> and
friends will create a <code>unitizer</code> id for you based on the test file
name and location, but you can specify your own location as an id, or even
use a completely different mechanism to store the <code>unitizer</code> data by
implementing S3 methods for <code><a href="set_unitizer.html">get_unitizer</a></code> and
<code><a href="set_unitizer.html">set_unitizer</a></code>.  For more details about storage see those
functions.
</p>
<p><code>review</code> allows you to review existing <code>unitizer</code>s and modify them
by dropping tests from them.  Tests are not evaluated in this mode; you are
just allowed to review the results of previous evaluations of the tests
Because of this, no effort is made to create reproducible state in the
browsing environments, unlike with <code>unitize</code> or <code>unitize_dir</code>
(see <code>state</code> parameter).
</p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to read through the vignettes
for details and examples (<code>browseVignettes("unitizer")</code>).  The demo
(<code>demo("unitizer")</code>) is also a good introduction to these functions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>unitize</code> and company are intended to be used primarily for
the interactive environment and side effects.  The functions do return
summary data about test outcomes and user input as
<code>unitizer_result</code> objects, or for <code>unitize_dir</code> as
<code>unitizer_results</code> objects, invisbly.  See
<code><a href="unitizer_result.html">unitizer_result</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>unitizer</code> approximates the semantics of sourcing an R file when running
tests, and those of the interactive prompt when reviewing them.  The
semantics are not identical, and in some cases you may notice differences.
For example, when running tests:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> All expressions are run with <code>options(warn=1)</code>,
irrespective of what the user sets that option to.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>on.exit(...)</code> expressions will be evaluated immediately for
top-level statements (either in the test file or in an
<code><a href="unitizer_sect.html">unitizer_sect</a></code>, thereby defeating their purpose).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Each test expression is run in its own environment, which is enclosed
by that of previous tests.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Output and Message streams are sunk so any attempt to debug directly
will be near-impossible as you won't see anything.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>When reviewing them:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ls()</code> and <code>q()</code> are over-ridden by <code>unitizer</code> utility
functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Expressions are evaluated with <code>options(warn=1)</code> or greater,
although unlike in test running it is possible to set and keep
<code>options(warn=2)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some single upper case letters will be interpreted as <code>unitizer</code>
meta-commands.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For a more complete discussion of these differences see the introductory
vignette (<code>vignette('u1_intro')</code>), the &quot;Special Semantics&quot; section of
the tests vignette (<code>vignette('u2_tests')</code>), and the &quot;Evaluating
Expressions at the <code>unitizer</code> Prompt&quot; section of the interactive
environment vignette (<code>vignette('u3_interactive-env')</code>).
</p>


<h3>Default Settings</h3>

<p>Many of the default settings are specified in the form <code>getOption("...")</code>
to allow the user to &quot;permanently&quot; set them to their preferred modes by
setting options in their <code>.Rprofile</code> file.
