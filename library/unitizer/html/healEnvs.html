<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Environment healing is necessary because when we let the user pick and chose
which tests to store and which ones to reject, there may no longer be a clear
ancestry chain within the remaining tests.
</p>
<p>The healing process is somewhat complex and full of compromises.  We
are attempting to create a self consistent set of nested parent environments
for each test, but at the same time, we don't want to store all the
combinations of reference and new objects.
</p>
<p>We only store new objects in <code>unitizer</code>, with the lone exception of
objects associated to a test environment.  These will include any assignments
that occur just prior to a test, as well as any objects created by the
actual test.
</p>
<p>There are two ways in which we modify the environment ancestry. If
the user decides to not store some new tests, then the objects created
in between the previous new stored test and the next new stored test are
all moved to the next new stored test, and the previous new stored test
becomes the parent of the next new stored test.
</p>
<p>The second way relates to when the user decides to keep a reference
test over a matching new test.  This is a lot more complicated because
we do not preserve the reference test environment ancestry.  Effectively,
we need to graft the reference test to the new environment ancestry.
</p>
<p>If a reference test that is being kept matches directly to a new test,
then the parent of that new test becomes the parent of the reference
test.
</p>
<p>If there is no direct match, but there are child reference tests that
match to a new item, then the parent is the youngest new test that
is older than the new test that was matched and is kept.  If no new
tests meet this criterion, then base.env is the parent.
</p>
<p>If there is no direct match, and there are no child reference tests
that are being kept that do match to a kept new item, then the parent
will be the last new test that is kept.
</p>
<p>The main takeaway from all this is that reference tests don't really
keep their evaluation environment.  Often this environment is similar
to the new environment.  When there are difference between the two,
the output of <code>ls</code> is customized to highlight
which objects were actually available/unmodified at the time of the
reference test evaluation.  Object names will have the following
symbols appended to explain the object status:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> ': object exists in browsing environment, but not the same as
it was when test was evalaluated
</p>
</li>
<li><p> *: object was present during test evaluation but is not
available in unitizer anymore
</p>
</li>
<li><p> **: object was not present during test evaluation, but exists
in current environment
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>unitizerItems</code>
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Could be more robust by ensuring that items in <code>x</code> actually do
come from <code>y</code>. This is particularly important since when
we re-assemble the final list, we don't actually use x at all.  Signature
for this should probably ultimately change to be something like
<code>c("unitizer", "x")</code> where x is just a data frame with column 1
the item index, and column 2 whether it originated from &quot;new&quot; or &quot;ref&quot;
