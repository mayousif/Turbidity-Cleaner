<h2>Migrate legacy <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> files to new test directory structure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function migrates the old-style directory structure used by
<span class="pkg">shinytest</span> (versions 1.3.1 and below) to new test directory structure
used in shinytest 1.4.0 and above.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
migrateShinytestDir(appdir, dryrun = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>appdir</code></td>
<td>
<p>A directory containing a Shiny application.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dryrun</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, print out the changes that would be made, but don't
actually do them.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Before <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> 1.4.0, the shinytest scripts and results were put in a
subdirectory of the application named <code style="white-space: pre;">tests/</code>. As of <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> 1.4.0,
the tests are put in <code style="white-space: pre;">tests/shinytest/</code>, so that it works with the
<code>runTests()</code> function shiny package (added in <span class="pkg">shiny</span> 1.5.0).
</p>
<p>With <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> 1.3.1 and below, the tests/ subdirectory of the
application was used specifically for <span class="pkg">shinytest</span>, and could not be used
for other types of tests. So the directory structure would look like this:</p>
<pre>appdir/
 `- tests
     `- mytest.R
</pre>
<p>In Shiny 1.5.0, the <code>shiny::runTests()</code> function was added, and it will run
test scripts tests/ subdirectory of the application. This makes it possible
to use other testing systems in addition to shinytest. <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> 1.4.0
is designed to work with this new directory structure. The directory
structure looks something like this:</p>
<pre>appdir/
 |- R
 |- tests
     |- shinytest.R
     |- shinytest
     |   `- mytest.R
     |- testthat.R
     `- testthat
         `- test-script.R
</pre>
<p>This allows for tests using the <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> package as well as other
testing tools, such as the <code>shiny::testServer()</code> function, which can be used
for testing module and server logic, and for unit tests of functions in an R/
subdirectory.
</p>
<p>In <span class="pkg">shinytest</span> 1.4.0 and above, it defaults to creating the new directory
structure.
