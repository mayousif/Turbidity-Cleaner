<h2>Plan how to resolve a future</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows <em>the user</em> to plan the future, more specifically,
it specifies how <code><a href="future.html">future()</a></code>:s are resolved,
e.g. sequentially or in parallel.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
plan(
  strategy = NULL,
  ...,
  substitute = TRUE,
  .skip = FALSE,
  .call = TRUE,
  .cleanup = TRUE,
  .init = TRUE
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>strategy</code></td>
<td>
<p>The evaluation function (or name of it) to use
for resolving a future.  If NULL, then the current strategy is returned.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments overriding the default arguments
of the evaluation function.  Which additional arguments are supported
depends on what evaluation function is used, e.g. several support
argument <code>workers</code> but not all.  For details, see the individual
functions of which some are linked to below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>substitute</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the <code>strategy</code> expression is
<code>substitute()</code>:d, otherwise not.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.skip</code></td>
<td>
<p>(internal) If <code>TRUE</code>, then attempts to set a strategy
that is the same as what is currently in use, will skipped.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.call</code></td>
<td>
<p>(internal) Used for recording the call to this function.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.cleanup</code></td>
<td>
<p>(internal) Used to stop implicitly started clusters.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.init</code></td>
<td>
<p>(internal) Used to initiate workers.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The default strategy is <code><a href="sequential.html">sequential</a></code>, but the default can be
configured by option <span class="option">future.plan</span> and, if that is not set,
system environment variable <span class="env">R_FUTURE_PLAN</span>.
To reset the strategy back to the default, use <code>plan("default")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If a new strategy is chosen, then the previous one is returned
(invisible), otherwise the current one is returned (visibly).
</p>


<h3>Implemented evaluation strategies</h3>


<ul>
<li><p><code><a href="sequential.html">sequential</a></code>:
Resolves futures sequentially in the current <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> process.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code><a href="sequential.html">transparent</a></code>:
Resolves futures sequentially in the current <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> process and
assignments will be done to the calling environment.
Early stopping is enabled by default.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code><a href="multisession.html">multisession</a></code>:
Resolves futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> sessions running in the background on the same machine.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code><a href="multicore.html">multicore</a></code>:
Resolves futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate
<em>forked</em> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> processes running in the background on
the same machine.  Not supported on Windows.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code><a href="multiprocess.html">multiprocess</a></code>:(DEPRECATED)
If multicore evaluation is supported, that will be used,
otherwise multisession evaluation will be used.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code><a href="cluster.html">cluster</a></code>:
Resolves futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> sessions running typically on one or more machines.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code><a href="remote.html">remote</a></code>:
Resolves futures asynchronously in a separate <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> session
running on a separate machine, typically on a different
network.

</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Other package may provide additional evaluation strategies.
Notably, the <span class="pkg">future.batchtools</span> package implements a
type of futures that will be resolved via job schedulers
that are typically available on high-performance compute
(HPC) clusters, e.g. LSF, Slurm, TORQUE/PBS, Sun Grid Engine,
and OpenLava.
</p>
<p>To &quot;close&quot; any background workers (e.g. <code>multisession</code>), change
the plan to something different; <code>plan(sequential)</code> is recommended
for this.
</p>


<h3>For package developers</h3>

<p>Please refrain from modifying the future strategy inside your packages /
functions, i.e. do not call <code>plan()</code> in your code.  Instead, leave
the control on what backend to use to the end user.  This idea is part of
the core philosophy of the future framework - as a developer you can never
know what future backends the user have access to.  Moreover, by not making
any assumptions about what backends are available, your code will also work
automatically with any new backends developed after you wrote your code.
</p>
<p>If you think it is necessary to modify the future strategy within a
function, then make sure to undo the changes when exiting the function.
This can be done using:
</p>
<pre>
  oplan &lt;- plan(new_set_of_strategies)
  on.exit(plan(oplan), add = TRUE)
  [...]
</pre>
<p>This is important because the end-user might have already set the future
strategy elsewhere for other purposes and will most likely not known that
calling your function will break their setup.
<em>Remember, your package and its functions might be used in a greater
context where multiple packages and functions are involved and those might
also rely on the future framework, so it is important to avoid stepping on
others' toes.</em>
</p>


<h3>Using plan() in scripts and vignettes</h3>

<p>When writing scripts or vignettes that uses futures, try to place any
call to <code>plan()</code> as far up (as early on) in the code as possible.
This will help users to quickly identify where the future plan is set up
and allow them to modify it to their computational resources.
Even better is to leave it to the user to set the <code>plan()</code> prior to
<code>source()</code>:ing the script or running the vignette.
If a &lsquo;<span class="file"><a href="future.options.html">.future.R</a></span>&rsquo; exists in the current directory and / or in
the user's home directory, it is sourced when the <span class="pkg">future</span> package is
<em>loaded</em>.  Because of this, the &lsquo;<span class="file">.future.R</span>&rsquo; file provides a
convenient place for users to set the <code>plan()</code>.
This behavior can be controlled via an <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> option - see
<a href="future.options.html">future options</a> for more details.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
a &lt;- b &lt;- c &lt;- NA_real_

# An sequential future
plan(sequential)
f &lt;- future({
  a &lt;- 7
  b &lt;- 3
  c &lt;- 2
  a * b * c
})
y &lt;- value(f)
print(y)
str(list(a = a, b = b, c = c)) ## All NAs


# A sequential future with lazy evaluation
plan(sequential)
f &lt;- future({
  a &lt;- 7
  b &lt;- 3
  c &lt;- 2
  a * b * c
}, lazy = TRUE)
y &lt;- value(f)
print(y)
str(list(a = a, b = b, c = c)) ## All NAs


# A multicore future (specified as a string)
plan("multicore")
f &lt;- future({
  a &lt;- 7
  b &lt;- 3
  c &lt;- 2
  a * b * c
})
y &lt;- value(f)
print(y)
str(list(a = a, b = b, c = c)) ## All NAs


## Multisession futures gives an error on R CMD check on
## Windows (but not Linux or macOS) for unknown reasons.
## The same code works in package tests.


# A multisession future (specified via a string variable)
plan("future::multisession")
f &lt;- future({
  a &lt;- 7
  b &lt;- 3
  c &lt;- 2
  a * b * c
})
y &lt;- value(f)
print(y)
str(list(a = a, b = b, c = c)) ## All NAs



## Explicitly close multisession workers by switching plan
plan(sequential)
